# Distributed Task Scheduler
**Creating a distributed task scheduler where:**
- Tasks are generated by multiple producers.
- Workers process these tasks concurrently.
- Results are collected and stored in a shared data structure.
- Mutexes ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.
- WaitGroups ensure all tasks are completed before shutting down.
- Channels are used for communication between producers, workers, and result collectors. 

**How it works**
1. Producers generate tasks and send them to the taskChan.
2. Workers pick tasks from taskChan, process them, and send results to resultChan.
3. The result collector gathers results from resultChan and stores them in a thread-safe manner using a mutex.
4. A WaitGroup ensures that all producers and workers complete their tasks before the program exits.
